Over a period of 3 months, during the internship, I took several courses on Udemy and developed an application, being guided by a mentor. For the development of this application I used a lot of technologies and libraries such as Java and Maven, PostgreSQL, JPA and Hibernate for the database, Lombock annotation to reduce boilerplate code, SLF4J for logging and JUnit for Unit Testing. Also during the internship, for a better organization, we used Azure DevOps. On this platform I received the tasks that I had to solve for each iteration and also uploaded my work to receive feedback and code reviews.
